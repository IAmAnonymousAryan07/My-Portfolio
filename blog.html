            During this process, I used a consistent approach to analyze and compare common qualities (or deficiencies) in each blog. I looked at the depth of each blog’s technical content and the usefulness of that content. I read a few posts from start to finish to get a sense of the writing quality and comprehensibility. I looked at how consistently each web dev blog publishes new content, and I did some digging to learn how long each site has been around. Most of these blogs are similar in that they offer in-depth articles on other areas of web development, making them ideal blogs for programmers.
